Cohabits with a monster
Magic lighting
The buildings slowly change colours
There are dozens of mage towers
It's bigger on the inside then the outside
The oldest buildings are seamless
Haunted by benevolant ghosts
People sometimes comeback to life, whole
Is on the back of a monster
Is built among treetops
Is constanly covered in fog
